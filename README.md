## 📖 Overview
**Telco-RCA** is a state-of-the-art simulation platform that uses **Graph Reasoning** to solve the "Alarm Storm" problem in 5G networks. It transforms thousands of noisy, cascading alerts into a single, explained **Root Cause**, allowing autonomous agents to troubleshoot infrastructure outages with surgical precision.

> **Key Idea**: Move from reactive monitoring to **proactive causal inference** by navigating a hierarchical 5G dependency graph.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 💠 **Graphical Reasoning**: Interactive 4-layer network topology visualization.
- ⚡ **Real-Time Telemetry**: Live WebSocket-driven alarm feeds and agent logs.
- 🧠 **Explainable AI**: Visual evidence paths showing *why* a node is suspected.
- 📊 **Dynamic Simulation**: 4 difficulty levels (Easy to Extreme) with up to 1000 nodes.
- 📈 **Performance Analytics**: Integrated MTTR, Accuracy, and Efficiency tracking.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![System Architecture](./assets/architecture.png)

1. **Frontend Layer**: A React-based glassmorphic UI that handles graph visualization and live telemetry via WebSockets.
2. **Service Layer**: An asynchronous FastAPI gateway that orchestrates simulation states and agent reasoning loops.
3. **Causal Engine**: The core logic layer that models 5G dependencies and generates failure propagation patterns.

## 🔄 Application Flow

![5G Knowledge Graph Concept](./assets/knowledge_graph.png)

1.  **Initialization**: User selects one of 4 scenarios (Easy to Extreme).
2.  **Cascade**: The engine triggers a fault; alarms propagate via the Knowledge Graph.
3.  **Discovery**: The operator uses tooltips and filters to differentiate noise from symptoms.
4.  **Resolution**: The AI Agent or User submits a diagnosis; the system validates accuracy.
